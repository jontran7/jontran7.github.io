            My name is Jonathan! I'm an HCDE major and excited to learn the following things in this class: how to be a real student, how to change my name, and how to make little robots that will do my bidding.

            Iâ€™m a senior in HCDE excited about the ways technology can change the way we see the world around us.

            In my free time, I enjoy: volleyball, photography, following an above average number of dog accounts on instagram, and eating a similar amount as a small family of four.

            There are many things that have changed my life and made me who I am today but the thing that has impacted me most is probably the campfire episode of Spongebob. Spongebob and Patrick are the GOAT user researchers dont @ me.
